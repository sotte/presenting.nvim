# Contributing ♥️
You want to contribute to this project?
Wow, thanks!
So please just fork it and send a pull request.

I tried to automate most of the maintenance tasks with `make`, so please use it.
Call `make` just to see what you can do with it.

There is also a configuration for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks.

A few things to keep in mind:

- Make sure to `make all` before you open the MR.
- Please document your changes in the code including type annotations.
  The documentation is generated with `make docs`.
  But make sure the [README.md](README.md) is up to date.
- We keep a [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file. So please add a note there for your changes.
